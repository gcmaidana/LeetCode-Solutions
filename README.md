# LeetCode Solutions

Currently going through the [Grind 75 list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=40). Doing all 169 questions.

Currently on [Week 1](https://github.com/gcmaidana/LeetCode-Solutions/tree/main/grind75/week1). 

All questions will be done in Python, unless there's a reason to use another language.

[Time complexity of built in Python functions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) (This is mainly for me so that I can reference it when reviewing a solution)
