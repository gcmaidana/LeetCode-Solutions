# LeetCode Solutions

Currently going through the [Grind 75 list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=40). Doing all 169 questions (set the schedule to 26 weeks and 40 hours per week to see all questions). I will not be doing premium questions as they are locked behind a paywall.

All questions will be done in Python and C++. I initially started doing these problems in Python and will continue doing so, but I'm starting to incorporate C++ as well because I would like to work in the games industry, or do embedded work, preferably, and those fields use C++ heavily. My plans are just to do specific questions first in Python to understand the algorithm/approach, then try it again in C++.

I have done all week1 questions in both Python and C++.

[In order to make sure I understand the solutions I write (or get help on), I have made videos for the problems. I'm currently making videos for week1 still, though I have finished writing all solutions for week1.](https://www.youtube.com/@gcmaidana/playlists)
