# Question link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/

# This just a classic sliding window problem, not to difficult to comprehend

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        unique = set()
        l = 0 
        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in unique:
                unique.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
                
    
            unique.add(s[r])
            count = max(count, r - l + 1) # r - l + 1 gets the window size
        
        return count
