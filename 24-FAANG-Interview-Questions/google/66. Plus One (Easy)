# Question link: https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/

# The time complexity remains O(N), even though we are inserting, because we're only inserting after we iterate through our list and cases where we have to append once
# It's not like we're making the insert call for every element, so it wouldn't grow exponentially with our input list increasing


class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        carry, index = True, len(digits) - 1

        while carry:
    
            if digits[index] == 9:
                digits[index] = 0
            else:
                digits[index] += 1
                carry = False

            if index == 0 and carry == True:
                digits.insert(0, 1)
                carry = False
            index -= 1



        return digits
