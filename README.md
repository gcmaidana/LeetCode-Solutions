# LeetCode Solutions

Currently going through the [Grind 75 list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=40). Doing all 169 questions (set the schedule to 26 weeks and 40 hours per week to see all questions).

All questions will be done in Python, unless there's a reason to use another language.

[Time complexity of built in Python functions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) (This is mainly for me so that I can reference it when reviewing a solution) 

[In order to make sure I understand the solutions I write (or get help on), I have made videos for the problems. I'm currently working through week1 still](https://www.youtube.com/@gcmaidana)
