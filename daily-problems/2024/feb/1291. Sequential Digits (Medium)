# All a substring of 123456789
# Think of sliding window, use a queue
# A stack wouldn't work because numbers need to be sorted when returned

  class Solution:
    def sequentialDigits(self, low: int, high: int) -> List[int]:

        res = []
        queue = deque(range(1, 10))

                res.append(n)
            ones = n % 10
            if ones < 9:
                queue.append(n * 10 + (ones + 1))
