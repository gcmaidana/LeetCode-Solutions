# LeetCode Solutions

Currently going through the [Grind 75 list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=40). Doing all 169 questions.

I also maintain a directory for the daily problems. Can't promise I will maintain continuity, but I try to not miss a day. If there's a specific problem you're searching for, you can see if I've done it and posted it by searching the LeetCode problem number since all files are named according to their number and problem name.

All questions will be done in Python, unless there's a reason to use another language.

[Time complexity of built in Python functions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) (This is mainly for me so that I can reference it when reviewing a solution)
