# This just a classic sliding window problem, not to difficult to comprehend

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        l = r = 0
        mySet = set()
        count = 0
        while l < len(s) and r < len(s):
            if s[r] not in mySet:
                mySet.add(s[r])
                r += 1
                count = max(count, len(mySet))

            else:
                mySet.remove(s[l])
                l += 1

        return count
