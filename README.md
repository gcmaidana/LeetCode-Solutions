# LeetCode Solutions

Currently going through the [Grind 75 list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=40). Doing all 169 questions.

I also maintain a directory for the daily problems. Can't promise I will maintain continuity, but I try to not miss a day. If there's a specific problem you're searching for, try searching the LeetCode problem number since all files are named according to their number and problem name.

I have a directory for [24 FAANG questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uJFdTEDpds). Most solutions are my own, but I found it interesting to do the problems and watch the video so I'm just posting my solutions. There's some overlap, so I copied solutions from the original source if there is. For example, an Apple Easy question is merging two sorted lists, but I already did that previously when going through the Grind75 list.

All questions will be done in Python, unless there's a reason to use another language.

[Time complexity of built in Python functions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) (This is mainly for me so that I can reference it when reviewing a solution)
