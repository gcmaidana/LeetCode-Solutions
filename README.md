# LeetCode Solutions

Currently going through the [Grind 75 list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=40). Doing all 169 questions (set the schedule to 26 weeks and 40 hours per week to see all questions). Currently on week2 section.

All questions will be done in Python, unless there's a reason to use another language.
